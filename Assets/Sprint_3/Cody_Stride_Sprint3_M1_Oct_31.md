## End of Sprint 2 Meeting:

This is our review meeting, where we focus on what we could improve from the way we worked last sprint, and how we can take the experience and knowledge we've
learned into the next sprint. Let's look at the positives and negatives of this sprint.

### Positives:
* Team Organization:
  Everyone on the team contributed in keeping stable organization throughout the sprint. This is something we hope to bring to the next sprint as well. Frankly,
  our communication was simple yet effective. We were consistent in it, as we'd be discussing our progress in the project every week at a minimum. If we can
  often keep having our meetings in the next sprint the same way, it'll surely be great for our team.
  
* Communication:
  One thing that was great about our team is the communication and transparency between everyone on the team. Nobody would shy away from suggesting new ideas
  which is extremely important in a team.
  
* Collaborative Teamwork:
  Coming into the next sprints, we are aware that we should continue working on the code the way we were previously doing. The development was very fluid and
  efficient when all of the team went on calls lasting hours while working on Live Share to all code togethr. This was of much help when it came to finding and
  fixing mistakes and bugs, and even in terms of allowing creativity. Ideas simply flowed better when all of us were looking into a common and specific area.

### Areas to Improve:
* Specifyng Important Ideas Early
  We had initially planned on using RecatJS and NodeJS in order to build the website, while using a technology such as MySQL for the database. However, during the
  sprint, aroudn the middle of it precisely, we had changed our ideas as the development was getting way more complicated than we had expected, so we instead used
  Next.JS and PocketBase. Although this was a great idea and immensely helped us for coding, it would've been preferable if we had come to this decision at a more
  early stage, since a lot of time into research on the past technologies had been put in by all the team. So, our objective for the next sprints is to have a very
  clear vision on what we'll be doing right from the beginning of our work. Thankfully, the change of technology likely won't happen as choosing what technologies
  to work with was a primary concern only for sprint 2.
  
* Familiarising Ourselves More With the Technologies:
  As only some of us in the team had previously worked with Next.JS, many in the team were progressively learning the technology all the while coding. It helps
  that Next.JS is easy to pick up and get used to. So, coming into next sprint, everyone on the team collevtively decided that we'd spend a few hours of our own
  time looking into the technologies we're using even more and completely familiarising ourselves with them in roder to work more efficiently in the next sprints.
