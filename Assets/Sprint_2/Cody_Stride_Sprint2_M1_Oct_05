Here's what we discussed throughout this meeting:

### Plan for this sprint
Next week, we all decided that we'd heavily work on the project in order to get off to a quick and good start. Firstly, we'll complete the basic design. Second of all 
we'll be working on the main CRUD features. Then, we'll implement the request a visit feature. Lastly, we'll be working on the search feature. As of now, all of us have 
already started to learn and get used to the necessary languages we'll eventually be using, so getting to work should be a relatively smooth process.

### Planned extra features we'd have on our site
We also started thinking about extra tools we'd be adding on our site. In order to make it more special and unique, we'd obviously have to add an interesting feature 
such as a messaging system or some sort of tool.
