## Here are the 4 user stories:

	#### Search for properties:
The user must be able to search for properties based on their preferences. As they'll have certain desired aspects in mind when it comes to their wanted house, the
user will have the ability to filter their search based on, for example, a number of rooms or the location of the house. When searching for properties, the search 
results will offer autocompletion.
        #### Requests for visits for properties:
The user must be able to request visits for listed properties. When pressing "visit" under a listing a calendar will pop up with all the available timings for a visit
the user is then supposed to click on one of the available dates and select an available time slot to book it.  When booked a confirmation message should appear on the screen
and a notification email is sent to the broker.
	#### CRUD operations on properties:

	#### CRUD operations on brokers:
This type of user, the system administrators specifically, will be able to perform CRUD operations on brokers. They'll be able to manage broker accounts by deleting them, or 
even have the ability to create some brokers accounts. This user could also manage the information associated with the accounts of the different brokers. In order to do this, 
the user must have a page where he can view a full list of the broker's different accounts.
