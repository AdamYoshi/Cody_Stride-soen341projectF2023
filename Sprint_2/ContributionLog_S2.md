Here's a brief overview on what each of us worked on throughout this sprint 2:

## *Adam*
Around 2 hours were spent working during the different meetings. This is the same for everyone else on the team, as we all worked throughout the entirety of our meeting times. Furthermore, Adam worked mostly on the README file and on the Wikis having the plans for the future sprint.

## *Mahmoud*
After Adrian completed the user stories, Mahmoud divided each of these into separate tasks that we'd have to focus on in future sprints. He had also spent lots of time considering how we'd build the overall website and what our approach for this project would be. During meeting minutes, he presented his ideas to the team and we ultimatey all had a general consensus as to how we'd go along in the development of the application.

## *Micekl*
As the Scrum master, Mickel had to organize the meetings we'd have. Furthermore, he spent time writing in detail what we had discussed throughout the meetings. Mickel also spent a few hours researching on back end development and how we'd be able to use it for the context of our site.

## *Mustafa*
Finally, Mustafa worked on the contribution log, taking all the activities each teammate had done throughout sprint 1 into consideration. Furthermore, he spent time on looking into how we'd implement our database to the website. This was then discussed with the project leader and the team in order to evaluate our project features and how realistic they were to implement.
