# Real Estate Website Application

Our goal is to create a real-estate web application which’ll potentially be used by people wishing to buy or rent houses and brokers. As a team, we aim to have a responsive and efficient website as a final result. In order to achieve this, we’re going to have to properly design our website using front-end technologies while also developing a back end to manage the data behind the scenes.
There are 4 different categories of people whoL'll be using our product.
* House buyers that can search for houses based on filters, save houses as favorites, request to visit a house, search for brokers and use the mortgage calculator. Obviously, they'll be able to send offers to brokers selling the houses. They can also have filters associated to their accounts.
* House renters that'll be able to do the same as house buyers but not need the mortgage calculator
* Brokers can create new listings for houses they need to sell. They can also edit and delete those. Also, they can submit purchase offers to properties sold by other brokers, while alos being able to manage offers they receive. Furthermore, they can find homebuyers accounts which have matching preferences to their listings. Lastly, the brokers can also request to visit a house on behalf of their clients, while they can also reschedule or cancel visit offers they receive.
* System Admnis have the ability to manage broker accounts. They're able to create, remove or even change the info associated to the accounts.

| Role         | Project Manager   | Full-Stack Developer   | Front-End Developer  | Back-End Developer  | Scrum Master         |


Let's take a deeper look into each individual's role:

* **Adam Chami (Project Manager)**: As the project manager, Adam's goal will be to decide the team's objectives and ensure that the development of the project is properly advancing. The project manager will collaborate with everyone on the team in order to help solve any arising issues and will assign user points to each user story based on the customer's requirements.
* **Adrian Nico Salvado (Full-Stack Developer)**: The full stack developer's job is to work on both the front end and back end as he has knowledge of how both parts of the site work. Adrian will ensure that both the front-end and back-end are well connected so that the complete website works properly. He will have to collaborate with the front-end and back-end developers in order to assist them in the aspects they're working on while also learning and applying new technologies that might come in play later on in the project.
* **Mahmoud Mohamed (Front-End Developer)**: The job of the front-end developer is to work on implementing the desired design for the site all the while taking care of the actions that occur when users interact with the many aspects of the site. The main technologies we plan on using to work on the front end for now are ReactJS and Bootstrap, which are frameworks for JavaScript and CSS. If need be, we'll use Material UI, a React library, to enhance the site's functionality.
* **Mickel Samuel (Back-End Developer)**: Mickel will take care of the back-end, so everything relating to the database and servers used for the development of the project. The back-end will allow the creation and managment of accounts and what listings appear or are removed from the site. The technologies used for the back-end will be Node.JS and Django, which are JavaScript and Python frameworks.
* **Mustafa Aboabdullah (Scrum Master)**: The Scrum master will be the one to organize all meetings that happen during the timeline of the project. He will ensure that the meetings happen whenever everyone is able, and he'll also take care of writing down the information that is mentioned throughout the meeting, taking notes of future goals, potential adjustments, and more.

## **Project Approach and Technology**
Here's a description of every technology that we'll eventually be using and why we've chosen it for the sake of our project.

#### First, for front-end:
* React: React is a widely used JavaScript framework. Many sites are built using React as it simplifies the process of creating user interfaces while it also helps in developing components which would usually be way harder to implement with JavaScript alone. Furthermore, the great thing about React is that it allows the programmer to easily reuse these previously created components. Overall, this frameworks enhances efficiency and simplifies development of websites. For example, React can be used for autocompletion in input fields.

* Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a CSS framework that heavily simplifies the design process of the website. In fact, Bootstrap provides us with many predefined CSS classes that can simply be applied to our site's elements which we don't have to code from beginning to end. This allows us to more easily style our website all the while keeping it responsive and efficient. As our goal in this team is to deliver the best possible product as fast as we're able, this framework will be of great help to us. As an example, with Bootstrap, we can easily make a navigation bar as compared to making it from start to finish with CSS.

#### Second, for back-end:
* NodeJS: This framework allows us to run JavaScript on the server side, which we don't usually do when we normally use JavaScript. This is very importnat as this makes it possible to create a full-stack application, since we can work on back-end aspects using it. NodeJS'll ease the communication between the server and the client, so it's often used.

* Django: Django is a web framework for Python, and it's very commonly used to make websites. Similarly to the others, it enhances efficiency as it provides many useful built-in components. Django, for example, simplifies the process of user authentification, which we'll have in our site as each user will be able to create an account which they can connect to with a password and email. It can however also be used for frontend, but we won't in the context of our project as the front-end frameworks we currently have are good enough to complete it. The Django REST frameowrk is used to connect the back-end to the front-end React code for example using API endpoints, for which React will send HTTP requests in order to access.

## List of questions:
* How do we divide our files for the gitHub
* The meeting minutes, how many times should we ideally meet a week
* Is the info we put enough
