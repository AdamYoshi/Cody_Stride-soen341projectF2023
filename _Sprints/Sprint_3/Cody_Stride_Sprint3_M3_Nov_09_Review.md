## End of Sprint 3 Review:

In this team meeting, which was our review meeting for sprint 3, we did the same thing as last review and summarized what the team should focus on improving and what ways should it continue to work.

### Positives:

- Team Organization, Communication and Collaboration between teammates:
  These were some very positive aspects of our team that we'd noticed last sprint, so we ensured that we kept these habits while working on this sprint. Fortunately, we did. In fact, since we've worked with each
  other for a longer period now, the communicaation between everyone was even better. Team meetings were easy to organize and there was more chemistry between all of us, which made everyone work more efficiently.
- Research:
  Throughout this sprint, there was a lot of research to do. When it came to implementing some features with NextJS or PocketBase, such as user authentication, we collectively had to find some methods that
  would allow us to successfully resolve our user stories. Thus, after much time spent researching, which was something we previously mentioned that we'd do at the start of this sprint, work was being done in a
  very efficient manner. We indeed did do a lot of searching by reviewing codes online, watching videos, etc. Also, we did that all at the start, which really didn't put pressure on us by the end of the sprint.

- Working in Advance:
  In the last sprint review meeting, we'd mentioned that we needed to clearly set our objectives from the start of the sprint in order to improve how we work. As briefly mentioned earlier, the team was actually
  focused from the get go. We began research and planning the moment sprint 2 ended, which was great. As we didn't have much time allocated for sprint 3 (only 10 days), this was an important improvement we made
  and will surely help us out for sprint 4 as well, since the timeframe is only slightly longer to that of sprint 3.

### Areas to Improve:

- Asking TA more questions:
  Our TA hasa been helping us out every single week by giving us some really good advice on how we should proceed with the project and by answering our questions. He often tells us to contact him by email if ever
  we have some questions about our work. However, we don't really do that much, even though our TA encourages us to. It is true that we sometimes come accross issues where his help could help us solve them
  at a faster pace. Although we do end up solving them, having had his help would've been more effiient, so we won't shy away from sending emails outside of lab times during sprint 4.

- Work Speed:
  Sometimes, we do take a little more time than necessary when working. Most of the time, it's because we're focused on ensuring that the program properly works without any errors. But, that time could be used
  more efficiently by focusing on other high-priority tasks and spending a little less time on perfecting the work.
