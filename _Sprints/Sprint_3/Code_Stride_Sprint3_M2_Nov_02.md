There are two main things we discussed during this meeting.

### Current progrss
We started by analyzing our current progress for this sprint. Each of us had already started research on what they'd be working on, and some had even started coding and implementing features. It's important that
we began early since this'd be a busy sprint and some of us would eventually have other midterms and assignments.

### Plan for this sprint
We also looked at what tasks were left to complete and which ones were even accomplishable for this sprint, since there were some that required extra research and we decided to leave them for sprint 4. For example,
with unit testing, which we were planning on doing earlier. We'd also assigned tasks more specifically to everyone on the team so we all had something to work and foxus on.
