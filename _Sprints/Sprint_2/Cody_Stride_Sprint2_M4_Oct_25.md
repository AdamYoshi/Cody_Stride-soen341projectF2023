# Info on the October 25th Team Meeting

On the 25th of October, the team had a meeting that took 5 hours. We have discussed the final submissions and tasks of this sprint and worked together on some of the components that were still missing.
##Topics Discussed:

- ### Checking with the team if there are any major errors that need to be fixed immediately:

  First and foremost, we checked with each team member if there was anyone facing any major issue that are delaying the submission of the sprint. In fact, we'd noticed that one of our teammates was having a hard time with a certain component, so we collectively went to search for a solution to the problem. We ended up finding another way to resolve it using a different technology.

- ### We check if all the required tasks have been delivered:

  We have checked with the team for the delivery of the required tasks. As the time for submitting gets closer, we focused on implementing the stuff that is asked for in the rubric.

- ### Deciding on the finished and unfinished tasks:
  We've created a log of the tasks that we have finished and the tasks that we did not do so that in the next sprint, we know the unit time of each main and sub-task. We understand, as our professor had mentinoed to us, that we wouldn't surely be able to complete everything we needed by the end of the sprint. The next thing to focus on is how we can learn from our experience and apply our newfound knowledge onto the next sprint. Now that our team has had more time spent with each other, we understand better how each of us works and this makes working in this team way easier.
