# Info on the October 18th Team Meeting

On the 18th of October, the team had a meeting that took 2 hours. We have discussed the flow of the tasks and the to-do and done tasks.

##Topics Discussed:

* ### Checking with the team flow on the tasks :
We have checked with each team member their flow with undertaking the tasks. We made sure that everyone was going at the right pace. We also started to discuss as to whether or not we'd continue to use the technologies we'd initially planned on using. After some time, we noticed that Django for example wasn't too easy to implement, mostly considering the experience level of everyone on the team. Furthermore, we had found out about React libraries, which woudl be of use to simpllify the creation of the front-end. React is a great technology, but it is unfortunately hard to utilize properly at the beginning stages.

* ### When is the other meeting is going to occur:
As usual, we decided on the time the next meeting is going to occur which is the 25th of October. Again, most of us have midterms around this time of the year, but we also understand that we have to leave time for the project in our schedule. Next week is the deadline for Sprint 2, so we want to get as much as possible done without hindering our academic performance.

* ### Deciding on the non-important tasks:
After finishing multiple tasks, we have found that there are some tasks that needed to be removed because of their high risk and low importance (low effect on the functionality of the sprint). For example, we won't implement the account system just yet, as it is very time consuming while holding no benefit to the tasks we currently prioritize. We're hoping to be able to implement this in sprint 3, when the main functionalities are completed.
