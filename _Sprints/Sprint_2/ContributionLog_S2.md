Throughout the entirety of the sprint, we coded using the live share extension on Visual Studio Code. During our meetings, this allowed us to work and test the code together.

### Adam Chami
Throughout this sprint, Adam helped out a lot in much of the code as he'd previously looked into Next.JS. Having mainly worked on the search functionality and helping out in a lot of other aspects of the project, Adam was a great aid to the team. Overall, he helped a lot with ensuring proper communication accross the team, as he took the role of team leader. A lot of research was put in from Adam's part, as he was looking for ways to use Next.JS as efficiently as possible while keeping a good pace in the project's progress.

### Adrian Nico Salvado
Adrian played a huge role in the sprint. He didn't shy away from explaining his idea of using Next.JS and PocketBase rather than the previous technologies we were using. In fact, this helped us out a lot as we were having quite a hard time with the earlier technologies. With his experience in Next.JS, he helped everyone in the team learn how to use it by showing everyone the ressources he'd used to learn it. He was leading in terms of writing code all the while helping everyone out in all aspects of the development if anyone had a hard time. Adrian focused on the functionalities of the site, mostly on allowing CRUD operations on listings. Thus, Adrian displayed great teamwork and problem solving skills throughout this sprint.

### Mahmoud Mohamed
Mahmoud, although still getting used to web development, put a great amount of work into this sprint. He made sure to not only familiarie himself with new technologies that he hadn't seen nor used before, but also helped a ton in building and designing the site. Whenever there was another part where design was needed, Mahmoud would help out and complete a simplistic and efficient design. Mahmoud also spent much time on writing down the project's progress, contribution log, and other important files.

### Mickel Samuel
Mickel facilitated the meetings we were having. He was many times the one to take the initiative and suggest that we call to work on the project. Along with that and helping out in organizing the task breakdown for the next user stories, Mickel had mostly focused on the management of data in the case of our project. He'd use PocketBase to constantly verify whether or not the site was functionning properly. He also contributed to the coding for CRUD operations on brokers. Mickel definitely helped keep the team organized

### Mustafa Aboabdullah
Mustafa, along with Mickel, also helped out a lot in terms of organizaiton. He worked with Adam and Adrian on having a good search functionality for listings 
However, while doing this, he was also testing the implementation of other features in the project, which we haven't completely used yet but are planning to in future sprints. All around, a great amount of effort and hours were put into coding and debugging from Mostafa. When issues would arise, Mustafa would always help out with solving these problems, which made it easier for everyone in the team.
