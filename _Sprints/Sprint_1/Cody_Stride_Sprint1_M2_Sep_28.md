# Info on the September 28th Team Meeting

On September 28th, the team had its second big meeting. Throughout the week, we'd met a few times to discuss the progress that we were making. However, we'd only
meet for about 10 minutes. During this meeting, we mostly clarified some aspects relating to the user stories and decide what the task breakdown'd be in more detail

## Topics Discussed:

- ### Confirming User Stories:

  Initially, we'd already discussed the 4 user stories and what they'd be. We then added more detail to them and confirmed that we would go along with these for the
  rest of the project. For example, we decided that for user story 3, we wouldn't concentrate on the brokers' ability to place offers for properties on sale, but rather
  for how they'd be able to sell and place houses on sale

- ### Writng Meeting Minutes:

  Throughout this meeting, we completed the meeting minutes file for sprint 1.
  We each mentioned how much exactly we'd worked during this first part of the project, and whether this eventually would need to be improved or not.

- ### Organizing Task Breakdown:

  We decided on how we'd divide the user stories by tasks, and we completed the task breakdown file later on. Soon, we'll need to make these tasks into issues on Github,
  as this'll ease organization of the project, letting us know what each of us have to do.

- ### Planning future meetings:
  We planned for eventual mini meetings we'd be having throughout the following weeks. Ideally, if we could have 15 minute discussions at least 2 or 3 times a week, it
  would of course help us advance faster in the project and complete the sprints more efficiently.
