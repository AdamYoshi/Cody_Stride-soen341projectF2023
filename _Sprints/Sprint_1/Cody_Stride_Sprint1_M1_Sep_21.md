# Info on the September 21st Team Meeting

On September 21st, the team had its first big meeting exceeding an hour. We discussed many topics about the project, but our main goal for this meeting was to get
organized in order to ease the process of building the overall project.

## Topics Discussed:

- ### What Programs we'll be Using for the Project:

  As you might've read on the README file, we chose 4 different frameworks to work with. We had already discussed previously that we'd use NodeJS and React to work
  on the project as all of us have experience with JavaScript. But, throughout this meeting, we decided that we'd be eventually using Django to assist in the back-end
  and Bootstrap for the front-end.
  We also discussed other programming languages, frameworks or libraries that we could potentially use to make our site more complete, such as Material UI and Bun.
  However, we decided to stick to React, Bootstrap, NodeJS and Django for the entierty of the project. If ever the chance comes, we'll be using these tools, as they
  could most probably come in very handy in certain situations.

- ### Individual Roles:

  We also verified that every team member was okay with the role assigned to them. Since we had already spoken about our respective backgrounds, this process was quick
  and easy.

- ### Thinking of how the Application'll Function:
  We extensively discussed how the site would work. We decided that we'd use an account and login system, so we'd need to use a back end framework for this.
  In their own time, everyone had read the instructions. However, we read them once again as a team to ensure that we wrre on the same page for the requirements, as
  we weren't entirely sure as to how we'd integrate these requirements in our website.
