This is the first meeting for sprint 4, the final sprint, so we had some important discussions in this meeting.

* ### Planning and Progress:
Like last sprints, we got together and analyzed what everyone'd done at the moment, and we established what needed to be done in the context of this sprint. 
For example, some teammates had already started research on unit testing in the previous sprint, so we discussed who would implement that in the project and how 
they'd do it.

* ### Set up a deadline for each task:
Since this is the last sprint and some very important tasks had to be completed, we decided to set our own deadlines for some of them. This'll help us organize our 
time and ensure that we finish all important parts of the project. We even set up the deadlines depending on the task's priority level, which we'd also established 
for each remaining task during our meeting.
