Today was the day of our lab, so we met together for hours to discuss the project and continue our work.

- ### Fixed Issues:

  We still had some issues related to the old sprints, most notably a bug when it came to broker CRUD operations and another one related to broker search. So, once
  again, we all got together hours before the lab in order to fix it.

- ### Worked on User Stories:

  While we were at it, part of our team foxused on completing one of the user stories for sprint 4 in order for us to be advanced in the project. During the meeting,
  the mortgage calculator was essentially set up and implemented.

- ### Plan for what's left:

  Thus, we had a clearer vision of what was left to be completed. So, we once again reviewed the deadlines we'd set and what we'd planned for later. Since we were in
  advance, we made some deadlines earlier so not everything would be left for the end. The day of the last lab, we all have a common final for SOEN341, so we're
  all trying to finish the sprint objectives in order to prioritize studying for it.

- ### Looked into GitHub Organizations
  We were also planning on making our repository an organization, which we'd quickly looked into and planned in the past. Turns out, it wouldn't take that much time to
  implement, so we briefly did it at the end of this meeting.
