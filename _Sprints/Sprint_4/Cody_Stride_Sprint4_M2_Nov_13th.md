We met together as a team to ensure we were all on the right track and continue planning

* ### Reviewing Code:
Every one of us had our parts verified by all teammmates and we all collaboratively worked together to fix the issues each teammate was having. We also ensured that 
the pace was well and that we'd have time to implement all user stories.
A big thing we'd completed throughout the meeting is fixing issues related to user authentication.

* ### Discussed Planning
After resolving the problems, we looked again at what was left to do. We also had to keep in mind that a report would eventually have to be written in order to prepare
to present our work. So, considering that, we reviewed the deadlines we'd previously assigned in order to ensure that they were realistic based on the work we'd now
completed. We didn't change much, but organizing and planning are always helpful as they ensure proper communication between teammates. They also keep everyone busy
with the project. In fact, when we wouldn't set our own deadlines, there were some periods of time where everyone was busy with other things and thus the project 
would be sort of forgotten. So now, we ensure that at least someone's working on it each day.
